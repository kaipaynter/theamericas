        The Americas produce a wide range of theatre, from musicals/musical show cases to comedies, dramas, and original new work.

      <p className='center'>
        After initial review, candidates will be selected both for the promise shown around their individual artistic voice and practice, as well as for how that practice might contribute to collaborative creation within the values and mission of The America's Theatre Company. These candidates will be selected for individual contracts to one or more specific productions within our producing season. Australian actors/crew are encouraged to apply if they have a vested interest in American works, culture, history, etc.
      </p>
      <p className='center'>
        Candidates should email their professional headshot/resumes, portfolios (links or PDF), and a creative statement to contact@beartigerproductions.com.
      </p>
      <p className='center'>
        All artists will be considered regardless of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, political persuasion or belief, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability, veteran status, or status as a whistleblower.
